## About Us
Omer Tzroya,
Third year Computer Science students at H.I.T.
I really like Python, I have a passion for experimenting with new things and interesting technologies.
This is our final project in the machine learning course.

## Description
This project focuses on predicting the gender of the author based on textual content. The task involves training machine learning models to classify whether a given text is written by a male or female author. The primary metric used to evaluate the model's performance is the F1-score, taking into account both precision and recall.

## Tools and Features
 This project is built using the following materials and tools:
- Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and re (for regular expressions)
- Text analysis techniques integrated with machine learning models
- Tokenized the text to vectors
- Implementing a correct machine learning flow according to the steps.

The project adheres to certain restrictions:
- Limited to the mentioned libraries, no external modules
- No external files or lists of words
- The data is provided in CSV format for training and testing

## Results
 The model's performance is evaluated using the F1-score.<br/>
The F1-score is calculated for both male and female classes, and the average F1-score is computed to<br/>
provide an overall assessment of the model's effectiveness.<br/>
The best model we tested is the Perceptron , with F1 score of 0.73


## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment3-text-analysis.ipynb`) to see the code and explanations.

## Usage
1. Load the training data from `annotated_corpus_for_train.csv`.
2. Preprocess the text data using various techniques.
3. Train machine learning models (such as Perceptron, LinearSVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, etc.).
4. Evaluate the models using cross-validation and calculate the average F1-score.
5. Use the trained model to predict the gender of test examples from `corpus_for_test.csv`.
